Advanced AngularJS Demos
===========

Welcome to our demos repository for 
[Advanced AngularJS](https://www.develop.com/training-course/advanced-angularjs) 
from [DevelopMentor](https://develop.com). 

If you are in one of our courses *right now*, **start by selecting your course's branch** and then just click 'Download ZIP' or clone this repo to your system. On the other hand, if you took the course awhile ago and want access to the demos, your course probably lives **in another branch**. Use the branches dropdown to find it or just contact us (requests@develop.com).

If you are **not** in one of our courses, enjoy the samples and please consider DevelopMentor for your [Web Training](https://www.develop.com/training-courses/web)!

Course Outline
----------------------

**Course highlights**

Learn best practices for building and testing AngularJS application through a thorough understanding of the AngularJS internals. Use the rich components of Angular-UI to enhance your application and test drive it with Protractor.

**Course outline and topics**

**Day 1**

**Root scopes, services, factories, providers, filters and decorators**

There are many ways functionality and data can be shared between different parts of an AngularJS application. In this module you will learn about the different options and the pros and cons of each of them.

**AngularJS Patterns**

When building AngularJS applications you will be faced with many choices. For example when to use a service or a factory, where to do validation or when to use the routing module resolve option versus dependency injection. In this module we will take a closer look at some of these choices and explore the pros and cons of the different options.

**Building AngularJS applications with NPM and CommonJS**

Managing dependencies is always a concern with any JavaScript application and AngularJS is no exception here. The AngularJS dependency injection functionality will inject dependencies it knows about but will not load them for you. There are different ways to load these dependencies and using CommonJS with NPM packages is a very elegant and effective way of doing this.

**Day 2**

**AngularJS Internals**

Getting started with AngularJS is relatively easy and requires little knowledge of the AngularJS internals. However when creating larger applications having a good understanding of the AngularJS internals is important. Without this knowledge itâ€™s easy to do things that might work in small applications but would result in a very slow or hard to maintain larger application. In this module you will learn more about the internals of AngularJS and gain more insight into why some things work the way they do.

**End-to-end testing with Protractor**
Unit testing your code is important but with unit testing it is easy to create lots of units that all pass their individual tests yet fail to work together. In this module you will learn how to use Protractor to test your application by driving the browser. Testing the complete application logic as well as the actual user interface will help you create much more reliable applications.

**Angular-UI**

Angular-UI is described as the companion suite to the AngularJS framework. Besides containing a number of useful lower level utilities Angular-UI also consist of a number of UI widgets that will greatly enhance your productivity when developing applications with AngularJS. Another popular part of this suite of tools is the integration between AngularJS and the popular Bootstrap CSS framework and its UI widgets. In this module we will explore these widgets and see some of their benefits.
